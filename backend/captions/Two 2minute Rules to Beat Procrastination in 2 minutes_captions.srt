1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
after reading tons of productivity books

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:07,279
I came across so many rules like the

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,599
2-year rule the 5 minute rule the 5c

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,000
rule no not that 5-second rule the

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,960
problem is that these rules were meant

6
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,839
for companies or entrepreneurs but I was

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,800
able to adapt them to my studies during

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,400
med school and drastically cut down in

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,800
my procrastination so I'm going to share

10
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,920
with you two different two-minute rules

11
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,400
for the next 2 minutes the first 2

12
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,480
minute rule comes from getting things

13
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:30,039
done by David Allen he says if it takes

14
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:31,519
2 minutes to do get it done right now

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:33,960
for example if I need to take out the

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:35,879
trash today it takes 2 minutes to do so

17
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,480
if I'm thinking about it now might as

18
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:40,079
well just do it now instead of writing

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,559
it down on a to-do list or probably

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,960
forgetting about it or having to come

21
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,760
back to it later which takes more than 2

22
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:47,840
minutes that's how I see it so here's a

23
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,640
list of things that might take 2 minutes

24
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,120
throughout the day like organizing your

25
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:54,359
desk or Watering your plants or clipping

26
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,840
those nasty Nails I just do it when I

27
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:58,000
notice it but these little things start

28
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,519
to add up so this rule biases my brain

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,000
towards taking action and away from

30
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,800
procrastination the second two-minute

31
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,439
rule comes from Atomic Habits by James

32
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:07,280
Clear he says when you're trying to do

33
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,280
something you don't really want to do

34
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,960
simplify the test down to 2 minutes or

35
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,640
less so doing your entire reading

36
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,880
assignment becomes just reading one

37
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,360
paragraph or memorizing the entire

38
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,640
periodic table becomes memorizing just

39
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,119
10 flash cards now some of you might

40
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:24,320
think yeah this is just a Jedi mind

41
00:01:22,119 --> 00:01:26,880
trick like why would I fall for it how

42
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,960
is this at all sustainable and to that

43
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,439
he says when you're starting out limit

44
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,399
yourself to only only 2 minutes so back

45
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,840
in med school I wanted to build a habit

46
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,399
of studying for 1 hour every day before

47
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,439
dinner so I tried this trick but I

48
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:44,240
limited myself to Just 2 minutes I'd sit

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,960
down open my laptop study for 2 minutes

50
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,240
and then Clos my laptop and went to do

51
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,280
something else it seems unproductive at

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,560
first right it seems stupid but staying

53
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,280
consistent with this two-minute routine

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,719
day after day meant that I was becoming

55
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
the type of person who studies daily I

56
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,280
was mastering the habit of just showing

57
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,719
up because a habit needs to be

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,640
established before it can be expanded

59
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,080
upon if I can't become a person who

60
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,080
studies for Just 2 minutes a day I'd

61
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:13,080
never be able to become the person that

62
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,200
studies for an hour a day you got to

63
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,120
start somewhere but starting small is

64
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,319
easier there's a lot of other useful

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,640
